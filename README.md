# Induced-Metric-Optimiser

![Figure 1](images/projection.png)

This repository contains the experiments and implementation for induced metric optimisers. These are preconditioning-based optimisers that utilise the induced metric, which is often illustrated in graphical visualisations of loss landscapes. Specifically, the approach involves pulling back the metric from a higher-dimensional space onto the loss landscape. This can be interpreted as a smoothed variant of gradient clipping.
